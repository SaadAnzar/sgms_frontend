        The smart waste management project aims to revolutionize waste
        management by integrating sensors and technology into traditional waste
        bins. These sensors detect the level of waste accumulation, allowing for
        real-time monitoring and management of trash. By leveraging this data,
        authorities or waste management companies can optimize collection
        routes, reduce operational costs, and promote environmentally friendly
        practices by encouraging recycling and proper waste disposal. The
        abstract emphasizes the implementation of smart technologies to enhance
        waste management efficiency, contributing to a cleaner and more
        sustainable environment. Through wireless connectivity, data on fill
        levels are transmitted to a central system or a mobile application,
        enabling efficient route planning for garbage collection services.
        Additionally, smart features such as compaction mechanisms or sorting
        capabilities may optimize space utilization and recycling efforts. The
        project ultimately seeks to enhance sustainability, reduce environmental
        impact, and streamline waste disposal processes in urban areas.
